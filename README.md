# NTerm

A high level ncurses wrapper for Rust, which makes writing terminal applications with a pseudo-GUI much easier (raw ncurses is a nightmare).

## Documentation

Found [here](https://gravityscore.github.io/nterm/nterm/index.html).

## Usage

Add nterm as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
nterm = "*"
```
